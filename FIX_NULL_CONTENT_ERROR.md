# Fix - NULL Content Error on Note Creation

## Issue

When creating a manual note, the backend returned a 500 error:

```
null value in column "content" of relation "notes" violates not-null constraint
```

The `notes` table has a `NOT NULL` constraint on the `content` column, but we were only inserting into `extracted_text`.

## Root Cause

In `app/api/files.py`, the `create_file()` endpoint was inserting:
```python
record = {
    "extracted_text": content,  # ‚úÖ Inserted
    # "content": content,       # ‚ùå Missing - causes NOT NULL violation
}
```

The database schema requires both `content` and `extracted_text` to be populated.

## Solution

Updated the insert record to include both fields:

```python
record = {
    "content": content,          # ‚úÖ Required by NOT NULL constraint
    "extracted_text": content,   # ‚úÖ Also store for consistency
    # ... other fields ...
}
```

## Changes Made

**File**: `app/api/files.py` (Line 107-119)

- Added `"content": content` to the insert record
- Kept `"extracted_text": content` for consistency
- Both fields now contain the same content for manually created notes

## Deployment Status

‚úÖ **Commit**: `7abd4b5 - Fix: Add content field to satisfy NOT NULL constraint`
‚úÖ **Pushed to GitHub**: Main branch
üîÑ **Render Deploying**: Auto-deployment in progress (2-5 minutes)

## Testing After Deployment

1. **Wait for Render** to show "Live" status
2. **Clear browser cache** (Ctrl+Shift+Delete) or use **incognito mode**
3. Go to: https://study-sharper.vercel.app/files
4. Try **creating a manual note** ‚Üí Should work on first try ‚úÖ
5. Check console ‚Üí No more NULL constraint errors ‚úÖ

## Expected Result

Creating a manual note should now:
- ‚úÖ Succeed on the first attempt
- ‚úÖ Not require multiple retries
- ‚úÖ Show the note in the list immediately
- ‚úÖ Have both `content` and `extracted_text` populated

## Why This Happened

The backend code was updated to use `extracted_text` (for OCR and file uploads), but the database schema still requires `content` to be non-null. The fix ensures both fields are populated for manually created notes.

## Summary

- **Root Cause**: Missing `content` field in insert record
- **Fix**: Added `content` field to satisfy NOT NULL constraint
- **Status**: Deployed to GitHub, Render auto-deploying
- **ETA**: 2-5 minutes until live
- **Impact**: Manual note creation will now work on first try

The folder creation retry issue should also be resolved with the CORS and middleware fixes from earlier.
