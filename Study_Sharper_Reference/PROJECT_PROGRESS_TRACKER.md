**Estimated Duration:** 2-3 weeks  
**Priority:** HIGH - Core AI functionality is critical for MVP

### Objectives
Establish robust AI infrastructure with OpenRouter integration, vector database, and RAG system, then implement core study features (flashcards, quizzes, practice exams).

### 📋 Current Status

#### ✅ Phase 3A: Google OAuth Integration (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Google OAuth sign-in/sign-up implemented
- ✅ Implicit grant flow handled with manual token extraction
- ✅ Users successfully redirected to dashboard

   - **Root Cause:** `createProfile` server action requires server context cookies, can't be called from client component
   - **Impact:** Welcome message shows "Welcome, !" instead of "Welcome, John!"
   - **Workaround:** Users can manually add name in account settings
   - **Fix Required:** Create client-accessible API endpoint for profile creation

2. **Email Verification Flow**
   - **Status:** Not tested end-to-end
   - **Impact:** May have edge cases

3. **Password Reset Flow**  
   - **Status:** Not tested end-to-end
   - **Impact:** May have edge cases

4. **Loading States**
   - **Status:** Basic loading states exist, could be improved
