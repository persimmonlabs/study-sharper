Refer to the 2 files in the Study_Sharper_References folder. There is a document outlining the master plan for the study sharper app. The other document outlines current progress and immediate next steps. Once you review these documents to gather context about the project. Begin working toward finishing the current phase. In everything you do make sure to be extremely thorough and professional. I want you to have expectations of perfection for yourself and for me. Make sure to do everything one step at a time. If you need me to interfere, make decisions, or make any changes in external sites (Supabase, Vercel, Render, Etc...) Tell me, instruct me on what to do, and wait for me to complete each task 1 by 1. Make sure to be very thorough, take 1 step at a time.
