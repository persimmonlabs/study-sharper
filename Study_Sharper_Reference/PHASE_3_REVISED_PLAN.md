# üéØ PHASE 3 REVISED PLAN - AI-FIRST APPROACH

**Date:** October 13, 2025  
**Status:** Phase 3A Complete, Starting Phase 3B  
**Priority Shift:** Authentication Polish ‚Üí AI/RAG Infrastructure

---

## üìä PHASE 3A: GOOGLE OAUTH - COMPLETE ‚úÖ

### What Was Accomplished:
1. ‚úÖ Google OAuth provider configured in Supabase
2. ‚úÖ Google sign-in/sign-up buttons added to login and signup pages
3. ‚úÖ Handled implicit grant OAuth flow (tokens in URL fragment)
4. ‚úÖ Manual token extraction and session creation using `setSession()`
5. ‚úÖ Users successfully redirected to dashboard after Google auth
6. ‚úÖ Profile creation logic added (though currently not working - see known issues)

### Known Issues (Deferred to Phase 5):
- ‚ùå **Google OAuth name extraction not working**
  - Root cause: Server action requires server-side cookies, can't be called from client component
  - Impact: Welcome message shows "Welcome, !" instead of "Welcome, John!"
  - Workaround: Users can add name in account settings
  - Fix: Create API endpoint (not server action) for profile creation

## üöÄ REVISED PHASE 3 PRIORITIES

### **Old Plan** (Authentication-focused):
~~1. Complete email verification~~  
~~2. Complete password reset~~  
~~3. Test Google OAuth~~  
~~4. Assignment management~~  
~~5. Study session tracking~~  

### **New Plan** (AI-focused):
1. **Phase 3B:** AI/RAG Infrastructure ‚≠ê **NEXT**
2. **Phase 3C:** Core AI Features (Flashcards, Quizzes, Exams)
3. **Phase 3D-F:** Secondary features (lower priority)
4. **Phase 5:** UX Polish (fix auth issues)

---

## üéØ PHASE 3B: AI/RAG INFRASTRUCTURE (STARTING NOW)

### Goal:
Establish reliable AI pipeline with OpenRouter, vector database, and RAG for personalized study assistance.

### Why This Matters:
- **Core Value Prop:** AI-powered study tools are what make Study Sharper unique
- **User Retention:** Students stay for AI features, not for pretty auth flows
- **MVP Viability:** Without AI, it's just another note-taking app
- **Technical Foundation:** Other features depend on this working first

## üìã PHASE 3B DETAILED BREAKDOWN

### **Step 1: OpenRouter API Integration** (Day 1)

**Tasks:**
1. Locate OpenRouter API credentials
   - Check backend `.env` file for `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
   - Verify key is active and has credits
2. Test basic API connectivity
   - Make simple completion request to OpenRouter
   - Test with GPT-4, Claude, and other models
   - Verify response format and latency
3. Implement error handling
   - Handle API failures gracefully
   - Add retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Handle rate limiting
4. Document model selection
   - Which models work best for flashcards?
   - Which for quiz generation?
   - Which for grading?

**Success Metrics:**
- ‚úÖ Can make successful API calls to OpenRouter
- ‚úÖ Errors handled gracefully
- ‚úÖ Response time < 10 seconds for simple queries
- ‚úÖ Multiple models tested and documented

---

### **Step 2: Vector Database Verification** (Day 1-2)

**Tasks:**
1. Verify Supabase pgvector extension
   - Check if pgvector is enabled in Supabase
   - Verify `note_embeddings` table exists and is correct
   - Check RLS policies on embedding tables
2. Test embedding storage
   - Generate sample embeddings
   - Store in `note_embeddings` table
   - Verify data persists correctly
3. Test embedding retrieval
   - Query embeddings by note_id
   - Test similarity search
   - Verify performance with 100+ embeddings
4. Add indexes
   - Create HNSW or IVFFlat index for fast similarity search
   - Test query performance before/after index

**Success Metrics:**
- ‚úÖ pgvector extension enabled
- ‚úÖ Can store and retrieve embeddings
- ‚úÖ Similarity search returns relevant results
- ‚úÖ Query time < 1 second for 1000+ embeddings

---

### **Step 3: RAG Pipeline Implementation** (Day 2-3)

**Tasks:**
1. Text chunking implementation
   - Split long notes into 500-1000 token chunks
   - Preserve context between chunks
   - Handle code blocks, lists, headings properly
2. Embedding generation endpoint
   - Create `/api/embeddings/generate` endpoint
   - Accept note text, return embedding vector
   - Use OpenRouter or dedicated embedding API
   - Queue large batch jobs
3. Semantic search function
   - Create `/api/embeddings/search` endpoint
   - Accept query text, return relevant note chunks
   - Use cosine similarity threshold (e.g., > 0.7)
   - Return top K results (e.g., K=5)
4. Context retrieval for AI
   - Build context from retrieved chunks
   - Manage token limits (stay under model's context window)
   - Format context for LLM consumption
   - Handle case when no relevant context found

**Success Metrics:**
- ‚úÖ Long documents chunked intelligently
- ‚úÖ Embeddings generated for all note chunks
- ‚úÖ Search returns relevant results for queries
- ‚úÖ Context assembly works within token limits

---

### **Step 4: End-to-End AI Query Pipeline** (Day 3-4)

**Tasks:**
1. Implement full query flow:
   ```
   User Query 
   ‚Üí Generate query embedding
   ‚Üí Search vector DB for relevant notes
   ‚Üí Retrieve note chunks
   ‚Üí Build context
   ‚Üí Send to LLM with prompt
   ‚Üí Stream response back
   ‚Üí Display to user
   ```
2. Test with various query types:
   - "Explain photosynthesis from my biology notes"
   - "Generate 5 flashcards about World War 2"
   - "Quiz me on calculus derivatives"
3. Add source attribution
   - Show which notes were used for the answer
   - Link back to original notes
4. Implement response streaming
   - Stream LLM response token-by-token
   - Show "thinking" state
   - Allow user to stop generation
5. Conversation history
   - Store recent chat messages
   - Include in context for follow-up questions
   - Limit to last N messages to save tokens

**Success Metrics:**
- ‚úÖ User can ask questions about their notes
- ‚úÖ Responses are accurate and relevant
- ‚úÖ Sources are attributed correctly
- ‚úÖ Streaming works smoothly
- ‚úÖ Follow-up questions work contextually

## ‚ö†Ô∏è KNOWN ISSUES (TO FIX IN PHASE 5)

### Authentication Issues:
1. **Google OAuth profile names not saving**
   - Severity: Medium
   - User impact: Cosmetic (welcome message looks weird)
   - Workaround: Users can add name in settings
   - Fix: Create API endpoint for profile creation

2. **Email verification not fully tested**
   - Severity: Low
   - User impact: May have edge cases
   - Status: Works in basic cases, needs comprehensive testing

3. **Password reset not fully tested**
   - Severity: Low
   - User impact: May have edge cases
   - Status: Works in basic cases, needs comprehensive testing

4. **Loading states could be better**
   - Severity: Low
   - User impact: Minor UX issue
   - Status: Basic spinners exist, could add skeletons

### Priority:
All auth issues are **deferred to Phase 5** because:
- They don't block core functionality
- Users can still sign up and use the app
- AI features are more critical for MVP
- Better to have working AI with imperfect auth than perfect auth with no AI
