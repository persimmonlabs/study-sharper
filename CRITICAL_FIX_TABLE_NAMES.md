# Critical Fix - Database Table Names

## Root Cause Found

The **real issue** was NOT CORS - it was **incorrect database table names** in `app/api/files.py`.

### The Problem

The `files.py` router was using **non-existent tables**:
- ❌ `files` table (doesn't exist)
- ❌ `file_folders` table (doesn't exist)

### The Actual Tables

Your Supabase database has:
- ✅ `notes` table (for files/notes)
- ✅ `note_folders` table (for folders)

### Why Folder Creation Worked But Note Creation Failed

- **Folder creation worked** because `folders.router` (separate file) uses the correct `note_folders` table
- **Note creation failed with 500** because `files.router` tried to insert into non-existent `files` table
- **Browser showed CORS error** because 500 responses don't include CORS headers

## All Fixes Applied

### Fixed in `app/api/files.py`:

1. **File Operations** - Changed `files` → `notes`:
   - `list_files()` - GET /api/files
   - `get_file()` - GET /api/files/{file_id}
   - `create_file()` - POST /api/files ✅ (manual note creation)
   - `update_file()` - PATCH /api/files/{file_id}
   - `delete_file()` - DELETE /api/files/{file_id}

2. **Folder Operations** - Changed `file_folders` → `note_folders`:
   - `list_folders()` - GET /api/folders
   - `create_folder()` - POST /api/folders
   - `update_folder()` - PATCH /api/folders/{folder_id}
   - `delete_folder()` - DELETE /api/folders/{folder_id}

3. **Storage References** - Fixed:
   - Changed `original_preview_path` → `file_path`
   - Changed `file-processing` bucket → `notes-pdfs` bucket

4. **Schema Adjustments**:
   - Removed `depth` and `parent_folder_id` (don't exist in `note_folders`)
   - Changed ordering from `position` → `created_at`

## Deployment Required

### Backend Changes:
```bash
cd "c:\Users\owenr\Desktop\Windsurf Projects\Study_Sharper_Complete\Study_Sharper_Backend"
git add .
git commit -m "Fix database table names in files.py router"
git push origin main
```

Wait for Render to deploy (2-5 minutes).

## Expected Results After Deployment

### ✅ Manual Note Creation
- POST /api/files will work
- Inserts into `notes` table correctly
- No more 500 errors

### ✅ File Operations
- GET /api/files - Lists notes
- GET /api/files/{id} - Gets note content
- PATCH /api/files/{id} - Updates note
- DELETE /api/files/{id} - Deletes note

### ✅ Folder Operations
- Already working via `folders.router`
- Now also work via `files.router` (duplicate endpoints)

### ✅ No More CORS Errors
- 500 errors eliminated
- Proper responses include CORS headers
- Browser won't show misleading CORS messages

## Why CORS Seemed Like The Issue

When a server returns a 500 error:
1. The error response often doesn't include CORS headers
2. Browser sees missing CORS headers
3. Browser reports it as a CORS error
4. Actual 500 error is hidden

The CORS configuration was actually fine - the problem was the 500 error from trying to access non-existent tables.

## Router Duplication Note

You currently have **two routers** handling folders:
1. `folders.router` (app/api/folders.py) - uses `note_folders` ✅
2. `files.router` (app/api/files.py) - now also uses `note_folders` ✅

Both are registered in `main.py`:
- Line 141: `app.include_router(folders.router, prefix="/api")`
- Line 144: `app.include_router(files_router, prefix="/api", tags=["files"])`

The first one registered (`folders.router`) handles the requests. This is why folder creation worked even when `files.router` had the wrong table name.

## Testing After Deployment

1. **Clear browser cache** (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. **Go to** https://study-sharper.vercel.app/files
3. **Test manual note creation**:
   - Click "New Note"
   - Enter title and content
   - Click "Create"
   - Should succeed without errors
4. **Check console** - Should see:
   ```
   [filesApi] Markdown file created successfully
   ```

## Summary

- ✅ Fixed all table names in `files.py`
- ✅ Fixed storage bucket references
- ✅ Removed unsupported columns
- ✅ Manual note creation will work after deployment
- ✅ All file operations will work
- ✅ CORS "errors" will disappear (they were actually 500 errors)

Deploy the backend and test!
