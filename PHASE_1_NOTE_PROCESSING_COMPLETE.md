## üóÑÔ∏è DATABASE CHANGES

### Migration File Created
**File:** `Study_Sharper_Backend/migrations/005_add_note_processing_status.sql`

### New Columns Added to `notes` Table
1. **`processing_status`** (enum: 'pending', 'processing', 'completed', 'failed')
   - Default: 'completed' for existing notes
   - Tracks current processing state

2. **`extraction_method`** (text)
   - Tracks which method succeeded (e.g., 'native_pdf', 'docx', 'ocr')
   - NULL until processing completes

3. **`original_filename`** (text)
   - Stores original filename when uploaded
   - Used for determining file type

4. **`file_size_bytes`** (integer)
   - Renamed from `file_size` if it existed
   - Stores file size in bytes

5. **`error_message`** (text)
   - NULL unless processing fails
   - Contains detailed error message for debugging

### Indexes Created
- `idx_notes_processing_status` - For filtering by status
- `idx_notes_user_processing` - Composite index for user + status queries

### Triggers Added
- Auto-update `updated_at` timestamp on note modifications

## üîß BACKEND CHANGES

### 1. Enhanced Text Extraction Service
**File:** `Study_Sharper_Backend/app/services/text_extraction.py`

**New Functions:**
- `normalize_to_markdown(text)` - Cleans and normalizes extracted text
  - Removes excessive whitespace
  - Preserves intentional line breaks
  - Ensures consistent paragraph formatting

- `extract_pdf_text_pypdf(buffer)` - Primary PDF extraction method
  - Returns tuple: (extracted_text, error_message)
  - Validates extraction quality (minimum 10 characters)
  - Detailed error reporting

- Enhanced `extract_pdf_text(buffer)` - Cascading fallback wrapper
  - Tries PyPDF first
  - Prepared for future pdfminer.six fallback
  - Prepared for future OCR fallback

- Enhanced `extract_docx_text(buffer)` - DOCX extraction with formatting
  - Preserves heading styles (converts to markdown)
  - Normalizes output to clean markdown

### 2. New Note Processor Service
**File:** `Study_Sharper_Backend/app/services/note_processor.py`

**Key Functions:**
- `process_note_extraction()` - Complete processing pipeline
  - Downloads file from Supabase Storage
  - Attempts extraction with cascading fallback
  - Updates database with results
  - Deletes original file on success
  - Keeps file on failure for retry

- `retry_note_processing()` - Retry failed processing
  - Validates note exists and has file
  - Prevents retry of already-completed notes
  - Reuses main processing pipeline

**Features:**
- Custom `NoteProcessingError` exception for expected errors
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Memory-efficient (streams large files)
- Automatic file cleanup on success
- File preservation on failure for retry

### 3. Updated Upload Endpoint
**File:** `Study_Sharper_Backend/app/api/upload.py`

**Changes:**
- Added `NoteStatusResponse` and `ProcessResponse` models
- Updated `upload_file()` endpoint:
  - Sets `processing_status='pending'` for new uploads
  - Stores `original_filename` and `file_size_bytes`
  - Queues background processing immediately
  - Returns note_id instantly (non-blocking)

**New Endpoints:**

#### POST `/api/notes/{note_id}/process`
- Triggers or retries processing for a note
- Queues background task
- Returns immediately with success/failure
- Prevents duplicate processing

#### GET `/api/notes/{note_id}/status`
- Lightweight status check endpoint
- Returns: `id`, `processing_status`, `extraction_method`, `error_message`
- Optimized for polling (fast query)

### 4. Updated Notes API
**File:** `Study_Sharper_Backend/app/api/notes.py`

**Changes:**
- Updated `NoteLightweight` model to include:
  - `processing_status`
  - `extraction_method`
  - `error_message`
  - `original_filename`

- Updated `Note` model to include same fields plus:
  - `file_size_bytes` (renamed from `file_size`)

- Updated `get_notes()` query to select new fields

## üé® FRONTEND CHANGES

### 1. Updated Notes Page
**File:** `Study_Sharper_Frontend/src/app/notes/page.tsx`

**Type Updates:**
- Extended `Note` type with processing status fields:
  ```typescript
  processing_status?: 'pending' | 'processing' | 'completed' | 'failed'
  extraction_method?: string
  error_message?: string
  original_filename?: string
  ```

**New State:**
- `pollingNoteIds` - Set of note IDs currently being polled
- `pollingIntervalRef` - Reference to polling interval

**New Functions:**
- `pollNoteStatus(noteId)` - Polls status endpoint every 2 seconds
  - Updates note state in real-time
  - Stops polling when completed/failed
  - Refreshes full note data on completion
  - Logs errors for failed processing

- `retryNoteProcessing(noteId)` - Retries failed note processing
  - Calls `/process` endpoint
  - Adds note to polling set
  - Updates UI to show pending status

**New Effects:**
- Auto-detect processing notes and start polling
- Manage polling interval lifecycle
- Clean up interval on unmount

**UI Updates:**
- **Sidebar Notes List:**
  - Processing notes: Greyed out with spinner icon, "Processing file..." text
  - Failed notes: Red border, error icon, "‚ö†Ô∏è Processing failed" text
  - Completed notes: Normal appearance (clickable)
  - Processing notes are not clickable (cursor-wait)

- **Recent Files Grid:**
  - Same status indicators as sidebar
  - Consistent visual feedback across all views

### 2. Updated Context Menu
**File:** `Study_Sharper_Frontend/src/components/notes/NoteContextMenu.tsx`

**New Props:**
- `processingStatus` - Current processing status of note
- `onRetry` - Callback for retry action

**New Feature:**
- "Retry Processing" button appears for failed notes
  - Blue color scheme (distinct from delete)
  - Refresh icon
  - Calls retry handler and closes menu

## üîÑ PROCESSING FLOW

### Upload Flow
```
1. User uploads file ‚Üí Frontend
2. File saved to Supabase Storage
3. Database record created with status='pending'
4. Background task queued immediately
5. Upload endpoint returns note_id (non-blocking)
6. Frontend starts polling status endpoint
```

### Processing Flow
```
1. Background task starts
2. Status updated to 'processing'
3. File downloaded from storage
4. Text extraction attempted:
   - PDF: Try PyPDF ‚Üí (future: pdfminer.six) ‚Üí (future: OCR)
   - DOCX: Try python-docx
5. If successful:
   - Normalize text to markdown
   - Update database with extracted_text
   - Set status='completed'
   - Delete original file from storage
6. If failed:
   - Set status='failed'
   - Store error_message
   - Keep original file for retry
```

### Polling Flow
```
1. Frontend detects pending/processing notes
2. Adds to polling set
3. Polls /status endpoint every 2 seconds
4. Updates UI in real-time
5. On completion/failure:
   - Stops polling
   - Shows final status
   - Refreshes full note data (if completed)
```

### Retry Flow
```
1. User right-clicks failed note
2. Selects "Retry Processing"
3. POST to /process endpoint
4. Status reset to 'pending'
5. Background task queued
6. Polling resumes automatically
```

- JWT token validation on all endpoints
- File access restricted to owner

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive try-catch blocks
- Detailed error messages for debugging
- User-friendly error display in UI
- Automatic retry capability

### Performance
- Non-blocking uploads (returns immediately)
- Background processing doesn't block UI
- Lightweight status endpoint for polling
- Efficient polling (only active for processing notes)

### User Experience
- Real-time status updates
- Visual indicators (spinner, error icon)
- Clear error messages
- One-click retry for failures
- Notes remain accessible during processing
