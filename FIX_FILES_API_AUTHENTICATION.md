# Files API Authentication Fix

## Problem Identified

The files page was showing an endless loading spinner and all operations (folder creation, note creation, audio upload) were hanging without completing or failing. No errors appeared in console logs.

## Root Cause

**Critical Issue**: The `filesApi.ts` was using a manual localStorage parsing method to get the authentication token instead of using the Supabase client's `auth.getSession()` method.

```typescript
// ❌ OLD (BROKEN) - Manual localStorage parsing
async function getAuthToken(): Promise<string> {
  const keys = Object.keys(localStorage);
  const supabaseKey = keys.find(key => key.startsWith('sb-') && key.includes('-auth-token'));
  // ... manual parsing ...
}

// ✅ NEW (FIXED) - Proper Supabase client usage
async function getAuthToken(): Promise<string> {
  const { data: { session }, error } = await supabase.auth.getSession();
  if (error || !session?.access_token) {
    throw new Error('Not authenticated');
  }
  return session.access_token;
}
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Authentication Method
- **File**: `src/lib/api/filesApi.ts`
- **Change**: Replaced manual localStorage parsing with `supabase.auth.getSession()`
- **Impact**: All API calls now properly authenticate

### 2. Added Comprehensive Logging
Added console logging to all major API functions:
- `fetchFiles()` - Logs URL, success/failure, file count
- `fetchFolders()` - Logs URL, success/failure, folder count
- `createFolder()` - Logs creation attempt, success/failure
- `createMarkdownFile()` - Logs creation attempt, content length, success/failure

### 3. Improved Error Handling
- All functions now have try-catch blocks
- Errors include HTTP status codes
- Response text captured for debugging
- Consistent error logging pattern

## Why This Fixes Everything

The authentication issue was causing all API calls to fail silently:

1. **Loading Spinner**: API calls hung because auth failed, `loading` state never set to `false`
2. **Folder Creation**: Requests never completed due to auth failure
3. **Note Creation**: Same auth failure prevented completion
4. **Audio Upload**: Uses same `getAuthToken()` function, so also affected

## Testing Instructions

After deploying these changes:

### 1. Check Console Logs
Open browser DevTools → Console and look for:
```
[filesApi] Fetching files from: https://...
[filesApi] Files fetched successfully: X
[filesApi] Fetching folders from: https://...
[filesApi] Folders fetched successfully: X
```

### 2. Test Files Page Load
- Navigate to `/files`
- Should see either:
  - Empty state: "No files yet" (if no files)
  - File grid with your files (if files exist)
- Should NOT see endless loading spinner

### 3. Test Folder Creation
- Click "New Folder" button
- Fill in name and color
- Click Create
- Should see:
  ```
  [filesApi] Creating folder: {name: "...", color: "..."}
  [filesApi] Folder created successfully: {...}
  ```
- Folder should appear in sidebar

### 4. Test Note Creation
- Click "New Note" button
- Fill in title and content
- Click Create
- Should see:
  ```
  [filesApi] Creating markdown file: {title: "...", folderId: "..."}
  [filesApi] Markdown file created successfully: {...}
  ```
- Note should appear in file grid

### 5. Test Audio Recording
- Click "Record" button
- Record audio
- Stop and upload
- Should complete without hanging

## Expected Behavior After Fix

✅ Files page loads and shows content or empty state
✅ Folder creation completes immediately
✅ Note creation completes immediately  
✅ Audio upload completes successfully
✅ Console shows detailed logging for debugging
✅ Errors are properly caught and displayed

## If Issues Persist

Check console for specific error messages:
- **401/403 errors**: Backend authentication issue
- **404 errors**: Backend endpoint not found
- **500 errors**: Backend server error
- **CORS errors**: Backend CORS configuration issue

All errors now include:
- HTTP status code
- Response body
- Stack trace
- Function name where error occurred

## Related Files Modified

- `src/lib/api/filesApi.ts` - Main fix location
- All API functions now have consistent error handling

## Next Steps

1. Deploy these changes
2. Test files page functionality
3. Monitor console logs for any remaining issues
4. If specific errors appear, address them individually
